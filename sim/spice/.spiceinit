set ngbehavior=hsa     ; set compatibility for reading PDK libs
set skywaterpdk        ; skip some checks for faster lib loading
set ng_nomodcheck      ; don't check the model parameters
set num_threads=20     ; CPU processor cores available
option noinit          ; don't print operating point data
option klu             ; select KLU as matrix solver

* Commented-out options; not necessarily ideal for my case:
*set xtrtol=1
*optran 0 0 0 100p 2n 0 ; don't use dc operating point, but transient op
