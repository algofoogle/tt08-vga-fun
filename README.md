# TT08 VGA FUN! (tt08-vga-fun)

![](./docs/tt08-gds-doco2.png)

An attempt to create rough 8-bit VGA DACs, targeting [Tiny Tapeout 08 (TT08)](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/), and building on my prior experiment (and first analog ASIC project) in TT06: [tt06-grab-bag](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt06-grab-bag).

- [Read the documentation for this project](docs/info.md)
